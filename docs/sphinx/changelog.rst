Changelog
=========

v0.2.0 (Unreleased)
--------------------

- **Entity Groups**: group ontology classes and expand/collapse them in the
  Digital Twin Knowledge Graph.  Groups are stored as OWL defined classes
  (``owl:equivalentClass`` + ``owl:unionOf``) with ``ontobricks:isGroup``
  annotation for UI differentiation.
- Group CRUD API (``/ontology/groups/*``) and Digital Twin consumption
  endpoint (``GET /dtwin/groups``).
- Ontology UI: dedicated *Groups* section for creating, editing, and
  deleting groups with class member selection.
- Sigma.js graph: super-node rendering for collapsed groups, edge
  aggregation, and toolbar with collapse/expand controls.
