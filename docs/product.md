### Slide 1: The Data Semantics Gap

#### Every enterprise has the data. Almost none have the meaning.

Organizations invest heavily in Lakehouse platforms to store and process data at scale. But structured data alone does not capture what the data *means* -- the entities it represents, how they relate, and what business rules apply.

**The five gaps:**


| Gap                         | What happens today                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **No semantic layer**       | Tables have columns and types, but nothing that says "a Customer *has* Contracts, which *contain* Invoices." The business meaning lives outside the data.                   |
| **Siloed knowledge**        | Domain expertise is trapped in documentation, ER diagrams, or the heads of senior engineers -- disconnected from the data itself.                                           |
| **Query-only exploration**  | Understanding relationships requires ad-hoc SQL joins. There is no visual, graph-based way to navigate across tables.                                                       |
| **Inaccessible standards**  | Industry ontologies (FIBO for finance, CDISC for clinical, IOF for manufacturing) exist but require specialized desktop tools that do not integrate with the data platform. |
| **No schema-to-graph path** | Building a knowledge graph from Lakehouse tables today requires stitching together multiple external tools, custom ETL, and manual RDF generation.                          |


**The result:** data is stored but not understood, relationships are implicit but not navigable, and knowledge graph adoption stalls because the infrastructure barrier is too high.

### Slide 2: Where OntoBricks Fits

#### A Knowledge Graph Builder that lives inside Databricks.

OntoBricks is not a separate platform. It deploys as a **Databricks App** and uses the services you already have.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph databricksPlatform ["Databricks Platform"]
        UC["Unity Catalog<br/>Tables, Volumes, Metadata"]
        WH["SQL Warehouse<br/>Query Execution"]
        MS["Model Serving<br/>LLM Endpoints"]
        TS["Delta Triple Store<br/>Subject-Predicate-Object"]
    end

    subgraph ontoBricks ["OntoBricks App"]
        OD["Ontology Designer<br/>OWL / RDFS"]
        MA["Mapping<br/>R2RML Mapping"]
        DT["Digital Twin<br/>Knowledge Graph"]
    end

    UC -->|metadata| OD
    OD -->|entities & rules| MA
    UC -->|table data| MA
    WH -->|SQL execution| MA
    MS -->|LLM automation| OD
    MS -->|LLM automation| MA
    MA -->|materialized triples| TS
    TS -->|graph data| DT
```



**Key architecture points:**


| Resource       | Role                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unity Catalog  | Storage for tables, domain files (Volumes), and metadata                  |
| SQL Warehouse  | Executes all data queries -- no separate compute                           |
| Model Serving  | Powers LLM-driven ontology generation and auto-mapping                  |
| Delta Table    | Triple store -- triples live in your Lakehouse, not in a separate graph DB |
| Databricks App | Deployment target -- `databricks apps deploy` and you are live             |
| MCP Server     | Exposes knowledge-graph tools to the Databricks Playground and LLM clients |


**Standards bridge:** OntoBricks uses W3C semantic web standards internally (OWL, R2RML, SPARQL) but translates everything to Spark SQL for execution. Users never need to learn RDF.

### Slide 3: The 4-Click Pipeline

#### From raw tables to a queryable knowledge graph in minutes, not months.

After a one-time setup (Databricks connection, LLM endpoint, triple store table), the entire pipeline is four actions:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S1["1. Import Metadata"]
    S2["2. Generate Ontology"]
    S3["3. Auto-Mapping Data"]
    S4["4. Sync Triple Store"]

    S1 -->|"UC tables & columns"| S2
    S2 -->|"LLM designs entities"| S3
    S3 -->|"LLM maps SQL"| S4
    S4 -->|"Delta materialization"| KG["Knowledge Graph Ready"]
```




| Step  | Where in OntoBricks      | What happens                                                                        | Powered by        |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **1** | Domain > Metadata       | Fetches table and column metadata from Unity Catalog                                | Unity Catalog API |
| **2** | Ontology > Generate      | LLM designs entities, relationships, attributes, and inheritance from your metadata | Model Serving     |
| **3** | Mapping > Auto-Map | LLM generates SQL queries and column mappings for every entity and relationship     | Model Serving     |
| **4** | Digital Twin > Build     | Executes all mappings and populates the triple store table                          | SQL Warehouse     |


**Traditional approach:** weeks of manual ontology design, custom ETL pipelines, separate graph database setup.

**OntoBricks approach:** minutes of guided, LLM-automated interaction -- all within the Databricks platform.

*OntoBricks -- Bridging relational data and knowledge graphs on Databricks.*

## OntoBricks — Field Engineering Innovation Project

### Summary

OntoBricks is a **Knowledge Graph Builder for Databricks** that brings **graph database capabilities and formal reasoning** to the Lakehouse — without requiring separate graph infrastructure. It transforms relational tables stored in Unity Catalog into a structured knowledge graph by leveraging semantic web standards (OWL, R2RML, RDF), a Lakebase Postgres graph engine, OWL 2 RL reasoning, and LLM-powered automation.

Users can design ontologies visually or import industry standards (FIBO for finance, CDISC for clinical data, IOF for manufacturing), map ontology entities to Databricks tables, materialize the result into a Delta-backed triple store mirrored on Lakebase Postgres, run **formal reasoning** (OWL 2 RL deductive closure, SWRL rules, transitive/symmetric inference), and explore the knowledge graph through interactive visualization. The entire pipeline — from raw tables to a reasoned, queryable knowledge graph — can be completed in as few as four clicks thanks to LLM-driven ontology generation and automatic data mapping.

OntoBricks runs as a **Databricks App**, making it natively integrated with the Databricks platform: Unity Catalog for storage and metadata, SQL Warehouses for query execution, and Model Serving endpoints for LLM features.

---

### Problem Statement

Organizations on Databricks accumulate large volumes of structured data across catalogs and schemas, but **understanding and navigating the relationships between entities** hidden in those tables remains difficult:

- **No semantic layer**: Databricks provides excellent storage and compute, but no built-in tooling to define or visualize the meaning of data — what entities exist, how they relate, and what constraints apply.
- **Knowledge is siloed**: Domain knowledge about entity relationships (e.g., "a Customer has Contracts, which have Invoices") lives in documentation, tribal knowledge, or ER diagrams disconnected from the actual data.
- **Exploration is query-driven**: Understanding how entities connect requires writing ad-hoc SQL joins. There is no visual, graph-based way to navigate data across tables.
- **Industry standards are inaccessible**: Established ontologies like FIBO (finance), CDISC (clinical), and IOF (manufacturing) exist but require specialized tooling (Protégé, TopBraid) that doesn't integrate with the Databricks ecosystem.
- **No path from schema to knowledge graph**: Building a knowledge graph from Databricks tables today requires stitching together multiple external tools, custom ETL pipelines, and manual RDF generation — a process that is expensive, fragile, and disconnected from the data platform.

---

### Proposed Solution

OntoBricks provides an end-to-end, web-based solution that runs directly on Databricks:

#### Ontology Design

- **Visual designer** (OntoViz) with drag-and-drop entity creation, relationship wiring, and inheritance hierarchies.
- **LLM-powered Wizard**: Point to Unity Catalog tables, and the LLM generates a complete OWL ontology from table/column metadata — entities, relationships, attributes, and inheritance.
- **Industry-standard import**: One-click import of FIBO (6 domains), CDISC (5 standards), and IOF (3 domains) with automatic module fetching, merging, and parsing.
- **OWL/RDFS import**: Load existing ontologies from files or Unity Catalog Volumes.

#### Data Mapping

- **Visual mapping**: Click entities on an interactive graph to configure their SQL source.
- **LLM-powered Auto-Map**: The LLM generates SQL queries and column mappings for every entity and relationship automatically, using domain metadata as context.
- **R2RML generation**: W3C-compliant R2RML mappings are generated behind the scenes — users never need to write mapping rules manually.

#### Triple Store + Graph DB Layers

- **Delta view (SQL Warehouse)**: Materialize triples into a governed Delta view `(subject, predicate, object)` with Liquid Clustering, full Unity Catalog lineage, and SQL-based graph reasoning (recursive CTEs for transitive closure, anti-joins for symmetric expansion).
- **Lakebase Postgres (Graph DB engine)**: A flat triple table on the App-bound Lakebase Postgres instance, populated either by `app_managed` `COPY FROM STDIN` streaming or by `managed_synced` Lakeflow synced tables. The same SQL primitives used on Delta run on Lakebase, with sub-second latency from the FastAPI process. The Graph DB layer is pluggable behind `GraphDBBackend` and `GraphDBFactory` — capability flags (`supports_cypher`, `is_cypher_backend`, `query_dialect`) reserve a slot for plugging in a future Cypher / Gremlin engine.
- **Quality checks**: Validate the triple store against ontology constraints — cardinality, value constraints, functional/symmetric properties, orphan detection, and more.
- **SHACL Data Quality**: Define W3C SHACL shapes across six quality categories (completeness, cardinality, uniqueness, consistency, conformance, structural) — shapes are compiled to SQL for execution against the triple store or validated in-memory via PySHACL.

#### Reasoning & Inference

- **OWL 2 RL Reasoner**: Forward-chaining deductive closure on the ontology using the `owlrl` library — infers subclass hierarchies, property entailments, domain/range typing, and class axioms.
- **SWRL Rule Engine**: User-defined Horn-clause rules with a **graphical D3-based editor** — compiled to SQL (Spark SQL on Delta, Postgres SQL on Lakebase) for violation detection and triple materialization.
- **Graph Reasoning**: Automatic transitive closure and symmetric expansion based on OWL property characteristics.
- **Constraint Validation**: Formal checking of cardinality, functional/inverse-functional properties, value constraints, and global rules (no orphans, require labels).

#### Knowledge Graph Exploration

- **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Sigma.js WebGL-powered graph with search, filtering, depth control, and entity detail panels.
- **Data Cluster Detection**: Detect communities using Louvain, Label Propagation, or Greedy Modularity — client-side (Graphology) for the visible subgraph, server-side (NetworkX) for the full graph; color-by-cluster mode, adjustable resolution, collapse clusters into navigable super-nodes.
- **Triples grid**: Sortable, searchable table view of all materialized triples.
- **Dashboard integration**: Embed Databricks SQL dashboards with parameter mapping to ontology entities.

#### External & Programmatic Access

- **Digital Twin REST API**: Stateless endpoints for triple store status, ontology/R2RML/SQL retrieval, entity search, and build triggers (`/api/v1/digitaltwin/`).
- **GraphQL API**: Auto-generated typed schema per domain with configurable relationship depth and GraphiQL playground.
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server deployable as a Databricks App (`mcp-ontobricks`) for Databricks Playground integration and LLM client access (Cursor, Claude Desktop).
- **Ontology Assistant**: Conversational LLM agent for natural-language ontology editing.

| Solution                       | Approach                                    | Limitation on Databricks                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protégé**                    | Desktop OWL editor                          | No Databricks integration; cannot map to tables or generate SQL                                      |
| **TopBraid Composer / EDG**    | Enterprise ontology platform                | Separate infrastructure; no Unity Catalog awareness; expensive licensing                             |
| **Apache Jena / RDF4J**        | Java RDF frameworks                         | Requires custom development; no UI; no Databricks-native deployment                                  |
| **Neo4j / Amazon Neptune**     | Graph databases                             | Separate graph DB infrastructure; data must be exported from Databricks; no native Delta integration |
| **Stardog**                    | Knowledge graph platform with virtual graph | Separate server; JDBC connector to Databricks but no native integration; commercial license          |
| **Custom Spark RDF pipelines** | DIY with rdflib + PySpark                   | No UI; requires significant engineering effort; no ontology design or visual exploration             |
| **dbt + Semantic Layer**       | SQL-based semantic modeling                 | No ontology/OWL support; no graph visualization; limited to dimensional modeling concepts            |


**Gap**: No existing solution provides an integrated, Databricks-native experience that combines ontology design, industry-standard import, LLM-powered automation, **graph database capabilities (embedded Cypher engine)**, **formal OWL 2 RL reasoning**, **SWRL rule evaluation**, **W3C SHACL data quality validation**, triple store materialization in Delta, and visual knowledge graph exploration — all deployable as a Databricks App without requiring separate graph infrastructure.

### Final Deliverable and Impact

#### Deliverable

A **production-ready Databricks App** (open-source, MIT license) that:

- Deploys in minutes via `databricks apps deploy`
- Requires only a SQL Warehouse and (optionally) a Model Serving endpoint
- Stores all domain data in Unity Catalog Volumes (no external dependencies)
- Supports the full lifecycle: design → map → materialize → explore → validate

#### Expected Impact


| Area                         | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data understanding**       | Domain experts can visually model and explore entity relationships without writing SQL                                                                                                     |
| **Knowledge graph adoption** | Removes the infrastructure barrier — no separate graph database needed; triples live in Delta or an embedded graph engine                                                                  |
| **Formal reasoning**         | OWL 2 RL deductive closure and SWRL rules bring inference capabilities to the Lakehouse — discovering implicit relationships, enforcing constraints, and enriching data with derived facts |
| **Graph capabilities**       | Lakebase Postgres flat-store graph engine (with a pluggable `GraphDBBackend` for future Cypher / Gremlin engines) provides traversal, shortest path, transitive closure, and BFS without deploying Neo4j or Neptune                           |
| **Industry compliance**      | FIBO, CDISC, and IOF ontologies become accessible directly from the Databricks platform                                                                                                    |
| **Time to value**            | LLM automation reduces the manual effort from weeks of custom development to minutes of guided interaction                                                                                 |
| **Reusability**              | Saved domains (ontology + mappings) can be versioned, shared, and applied to new datasets                                                                                                 |
| **Data quality**             | Built-in quality checks and formal constraint validation ensure the knowledge graph adheres to ontology semantics                                                                          |


#### Target Users

- **Data engineers** building semantic layers on Databricks
- **Domain experts** (finance, healthcare, manufacturing) who need to model and explore entity relationships
- **Data architects** evaluating knowledge graph approaches on Lakehouse platforms
- **Field engineers** demonstrating Databricks capabilities for knowledge management and data governance use cases
