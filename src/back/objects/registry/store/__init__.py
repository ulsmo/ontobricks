"""Registry data-store abstraction.

The :class:`RegistryStore` ABC is the single seam between the registry
services (:mod:`back.objects.registry.RegistryService`,
:mod:`back.objects.registry.PermissionService`,
:mod:`back.objects.registry.scheduler`,
:mod:`back.objects.session.GlobalConfigService`) and the underlying
Lakebase Postgres storage.

A single concrete backend is supported:

- :mod:`back.objects.registry.store.lakebase` — Postgres tables on
  Databricks Lakebase. Requires the ``lakebase`` extra (psycopg3 +
  psycopg-pool) and is imported lazily so that import failures surface
  only when a store is actually instantiated.

Always go through :class:`RegistryFactory` to obtain a concrete store
— call sites must not import the ``lakebase`` subpackage directly.

Binary artifacts (``documents/`` and ``*.lbug.tar.gz``) always live on
the Unity Catalog Volume and are managed by
:class:`back.core.databricks.VolumeFileService` — the store handles
JSON-shaped data only.

The historical JSON-on-Volume backend (``VolumeRegistryStore``) was
removed in v0.4.0. Operators with on-Volume registry data must run
``scripts/migrate-registry-to-lakebase.sh`` once before upgrading.
