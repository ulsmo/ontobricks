"""Domain-version lifecycle state machine.

A domain version moves through three lifecycle states::

    DRAFT  ->  IN-REVIEW  ->  PUBLISHED
      ^___________|  |____________|
                          (admin only)

Rules (see plan ``domain_status_lifecycle``):

* ``DRAFT -> IN-REVIEW``    — Admin or Builder. Precondition: the version
  has been built at least once (``last_build`` is set). Locks editing.
* ``IN-REVIEW -> DRAFT``    — Admin or Builder. Re-enables editing.
* ``IN-REVIEW -> PUBLISHED``— Admin or Builder.
* ``PUBLISHED -> DRAFT``    — Admin only (reversible publish).
* No direct ``DRAFT -> PUBLISHED`` (must pass through IN-REVIEW).
* New versions are always created as ``DRAFT``.

This module is the single source of truth for the transition rules so the
HTTP endpoint, the service layer and the tests all agree.
